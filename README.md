# ‚úçÔ∏è`About`
* Hello, this is the part that uses Discord's new feature: the Slash Commands (`/`)
* Probably in some time this repository will cease to exist (`F`), but, while Sen'ichi is not yet fully migrated to Kotlin, it will still exist as long as Sen'ichi is not migrated!
* The Sen'ichi Slash Commands are made using a library called: [DiscordInteraKTions](https://github.com/LorittaBot/DiscordInteraKTions)! If you want, go to the repository and give it a star ^^
# üöÄ `Selfhosting`
* If you want to use this project to make your own Slash Commands, you can selfhost it (you will need to have at least JDK 15)!
* Or if you want, you can contribute to the production of the Slash Commands for Sen'ichi himself!
